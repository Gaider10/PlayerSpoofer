# PlayerSpoofer
A clientside fabric mod that lets you change other players' names and skins

To spoof a player use  
`/spoof <playerName> <newSkinOwnerName> <newName>`  
`newName` can have basic ยง formatting using &, but in that case you need to put it in ""
  
To unspoof a player use  
`/unspoof <playerName>`  
  
Examples  
`/spoof Gaider10 Notch Notch`  
`/spoof Gaider10 _jeb "&c_&6j&2e&1b"`  
`/unspoof Gaider10`  
  
All spoofed players are automatically unspoofed when you leave the world/server
